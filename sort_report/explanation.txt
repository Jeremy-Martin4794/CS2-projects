The subscript operator function took the longest time (35.10% of total run time) (2.51 seconds).
The subscript operator is called each time an index of the vector needs to be accessed.
The Bubble Sort function itself calls the subscript operator many times as it iterates through the indexes.
The subscript operator is a bottleneck because of the sheer amount of calls that are made to the function throughout the program.

The Bubble Sort Function is also somewhat of a bottleneck taking the second longest amount of time (19.58% of total run time) (1.40 seconds).
It must iterate through all the indexes, check whether that value is greater than the one after, and if so, swap the values.
It must iterate until it has reached the end of the indexes and swapped all values that need to be swapped.
Even though it is only called once, it still takes up the second greatest amount of time.
