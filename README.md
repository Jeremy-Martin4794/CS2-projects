# CS2-projects
This is a collection of all the projects I've worked on in my CS2 Data Structures class. 
Projects range from multiple small labs to four larger, quarter semester long projects.
The four bigger projects include: 
*bigint (creating a data structure to store a larger number than the buil-in integer type)
*string (implementing a custom string class and methods)
*assembler (creating a program to give assembly code instructions for a given input)
*profiler (using a tree data structure to implement a profiling program)
